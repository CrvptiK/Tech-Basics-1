#now for the main loop
#to be totally honest, a good portion of this was done with chatgpt bc im sick off my rocker and cant focus at all
#i did however not give chatgpt the google sheet file (a bc i dont want to give personal data to it and b bc i wanted to at least do some part of this assignment myself, even tho im sick)
#i mainly put in the correct numbers (i hope theyre correct at least) and fixed the code, for example with the sixth week being skipped and with 7 being in the file but empty score wise
